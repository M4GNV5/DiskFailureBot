# DiskFailureBot
Bot which sends blinking gifs when disks fail.

We wanted to have a Telegram bot which notifies everyone when one of the disks in a RAID dies. The idea came up to use a stock image of the server and simulate the broken disk blinking light.

## Commands
- `/status` retrieve the current status of all disks
- `/demo` get a demo gif with randomly broken disks (it needs some way of showing off its coolness, even when all disks are operational)
